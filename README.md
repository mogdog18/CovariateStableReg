Comparisons  
- stable reg without weights and stable reg with weights
- compare stable reg with weights and random with weights 



HOW TO GENERATE COVARIATE SHIFTS

- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08637.pdf (ALSO DOES IT LIKE Huang)
- code to implement that way: https://github.com/MachineLearningBCAM/MRCs-for-Covariate-Shift-Adaptation/blob/main/Matlab_Code%20/CovShift_Generation/CSG_Features.m
